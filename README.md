# Suncoast Overflow

A basic stack overflow clone

App built using react, backend built with C#.

This project was a collaboration. I built the frontend and the back end was [built by jes7078](https://github.com/jes7078/SuncoastOverflowAPI)

You may have to wait a little bit for the data to load due to the API being on sleep mode
